## 6. Build Steps

### 1. **Cut the Wood to Size**

- **Shelves**: Cut 20 adjustable shelves (5 per section) to fit the 12-inch depth and ~38.5-inch width of each section (¾-inch plywood).
- **Vertical Dividers**: Cut 4 vertical panels to **73.5 inches tall** and 12 inches deep (¾-inch plywood) for the upper sections (above the base cabinets).
- **Top Piece**: Cut the top piece to 154 inches long and 12 inches deep (¾-inch plywood).
- **Back Panel**: Cut a plywood or beadboard back panel to 154 inches wide and **73.5 inches tall** (¼-inch plywood or beadboard).
- **Framing for the 4-inch Gap**: Cut additional pieces to fill the 4-inch remaining gap on one side of the bookcase using ¾-inch plywood. You can customize this area for storage or as trim to fill the space.

### 2. **Assemble the Frame**

- **Vertical Dividers and Top Shelf**: Attach the 4 vertical dividers to the top plywood piece. Ensure the sections are evenly spaced (~38.5 inches apart).
- **Shelves**: Attach adjustable shelf brackets inside each section and insert the shelves once complete.
- **Back Panel**: Secure the plywood or beadboard back panel to the rear of the bookshelf using finishing nails or screws.
- **Fill the 4-inch Gap**: Add framing to cover the remaining 4-inch gap with plywood or trim, giving the unit a cohesive look.

### 3. **Install the French Cleat System**

- **Cut the Cleats**: Use ¾-inch plywood and cut two strips (154 inches long, 3-4 inches wide) at a 45-degree angle.
- **Install the Wall Cleat**: Attach one cleat to the wall using screws into the wall studs, ensuring it's level.
- **Install the Bookshelf Cleat**: Attach the matching cleat to the back of the bookshelf, ensuring it’s flush with the top of the unit.
- **Hang the Bookshelf**: Lift and hook the bookshelf cleat onto the wall cleat, ensuring they interlock securely.

### 4. **Install Bottom Cabinets**

- Place the **Home Depot base cabinets** (30 inches wide x 24 inches deep x 34.5 inches high) along the bottom of the bookshelf area.
- Ensure the cabinets are level and secured to the wall studs for stability.
- Adjust the layout to leave a 4-inch gap on one side, which will be filled with plywood trim or custom shelving.

### 5. **Attach Adjustable Shelves**

- Install adjustable shelf brackets inside each section at the desired heights.
- Insert the 20 shelves into the brackets, making sure they fit snugly and securely.

### 6. **Install the Back Panel**

- Measure and cut a **¼-inch plywood** or beadboard back panel to the dimensions of the upper shelving unit (**73.5 inches tall** by 154 inches wide).
- Secure the back panel to the rear of the upper shelving unit using finishing nails or screws.
- Ensure the back panel fits snugly and covers the entire unit for a clean, finished look.

### 7. **Install Crown Molding**

- Measure and cut crown molding to fit along the top edge of the bookshelf.
- Attach the crown molding using a nail gun or hammer and finishing nails.
- Ensure the corners are mitered for a clean fit, and use wood filler to cover any gaps or nail holes.
- Sand and finish the crown molding to match the rest of the bookshelf.

### 8. **Sanding and Finishing**

- Sand the entire surface of the bookshelf, including shelves, framing, and molding.
- Apply wood filler to any gaps, screw holes, or imperfections, then sand again to achieve a smooth finish.
- Apply primer if you are painting the plywood framing.
- Paint or stain the bookshelf and cabinets, applying multiple coats if necessary, and let each coat dry completely.
- Apply a protective topcoat, such as polyurethane, if desired for extra durability.

### 9. **Final Installation**

- Secure the **Home Depot base cabinets** to the wall, ensuring they are level and attached to wall studs for stability.
- Install the plywood-framed shelves and dividers on top of the cabinets, using the **French cleat system** for the upper sections.
- Attach any additional trim or molding to cover gaps and give the unit a built-in look.
- Touch up any paint or finish as needed after installation.

## 9. Notes and Ideas

- [ ]  Consider adding LED strip lighting under the upper shelves for a modern touch.
- [ ]  Use the remaining 4-inch gap for a custom vertical storage niche or decorative feature.
- [ ]  Ensure the load-bearing capacity of the adjustable shelves can handle heavy books or items.
- [ ]  Consider using custom handles or knobs for the base cabinets to match the overall design of the bookshelf.

---

## 10. Additional Considerations

- **Plywood Selection**: Make sure to use **¾-inch plywood** for structural components (shelves and framing) and **¼-inch plywood** for the back panel to maintain durability and stability.
- **Base Cabinets**: Secure the Home Depot base cabinets to the wall with wall anchors or screws into studs to ensure stability, especially with the heavy load of books and other items.
- **Framing**: Use additional plywood or trim pieces to frame out any gaps for a seamless built-in look.
- **Painting and Finishing**: Apply multiple coats of paint or stain and allow each coat to dry fully to achieve a professional finish.
